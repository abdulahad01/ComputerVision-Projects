# OpenCV

Learning and tinkering with Computer vision using OpenCV-Python is one of my favorite pastimes . Here I am sharing some of my fun projects , which will hopefully interest you too!.

### Invisible cloth :

The program works by storing the background and then embedding the background on the detected color. This is a beginner project which helped me to learn color detection and basis image/video operations.

### Document Scanner :
This is a project that imitates populor document scanner apps.
